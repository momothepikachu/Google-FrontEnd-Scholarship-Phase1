			<p class="fact">This is a portrait I drew for Toby, our family pet and best friend. He is Peke-A-Tese, which is a mix between Maltese and Pekingese. Toby's favorite thing to do is sleeping on the couch, lying in the sunny spot or napping on our laps. </p>

			<p>Toby is a member of our family. He was very little when we first took him home 12 years ago. Now he is still a small dog, but he is never shy to challenge larger dogs by barking at them fiercely when we walk him outside of the house. Anyways, we love him, and I know that he loves us too.</p>
